I am what some people call a self sufficient "full stack developer". I know my way around data modeling, database tuning, scale-able architecture, front end code, service design, and performance. My passion is building a product, solving problems, and mentoring young engineers. 

Instead of a blog I have an infrequent newsletter. Iâ€™m not going to sell your email address, or try to get you to buy something from me. I just want to experiment and see what happens. You can unsubscribe at anytime, of course.
