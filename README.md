I am what some people call a self sufficient "full stack developer". I know my way around data modeling, database tuning, scale-able architecture, front end code, service design, and performance. I enjoy solving problems and mentoring young engineers. 

My passion is building software, but when I am not doing that you can find me:
- working on DIY projects with my wife
- all kinds of outdoor activities with my kids
- building furniture in my wood shop (aka: the garage)
- tinkering around with side projects

Instead of a blog, I have an infrequent newsletter. It is only for fun. Iâ€™m not going to sell your email address, or try to get you to buy something from me. I just want to experiment and see what happens.
